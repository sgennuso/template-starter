### Icon Requests + Suggestions
New icon design mostly starts as requests by the [Font Awesome Pro community on GitHub](../../issues).

#### Requesting Individual Icons
**We are currently not accepting individual icon requests**. This may change in the future, but for now we're focused on Icon Categories. However, if you have a specific brand icon you would like added, you may request it in the [official brand icon request thread](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome-Pro/issues/232).

#### Requesting Icon Categories
1. Please [search](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome-Pro/labels/icon%20category%20request) to see if your icon category request already exists. If a request is found, please add a üëç reaction to that one.
2. If you're adding a new request, please and thank you if you title your [new issue](../../issues/new?title=Category%20Request:%20) `Category Request: Category Name` (e.g., `Category Request: Desserts`).
3. Include a few examples of icons or subjects to be covered in the category. How do you plan on using it?

Please note: at the moment **we are not accepting external icon contributions**.

### Reporting Security Issues
Please do not report security issues in public. Please email hello@fontawesome.com.
